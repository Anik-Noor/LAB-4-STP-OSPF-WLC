# LAB-4: STP, OSPF, and WLC Configuration Lab

This Cisco Packet Tracer lab project combines three essential networking concepts: **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**, **OSPF Routing**, and **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)** configuration. Each section is designed to demonstrate real-world enterprise network setups.

---

## 🔧 Lab Objectives

- ✔️ Prevent network loops using **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**
- ✔️ Configure **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** for dynamic inter-router communication
- ✔️ Deploy and manage a **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)** with Access Points and client devices
